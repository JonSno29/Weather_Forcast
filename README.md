# Weather_Forcast

## OVERVIEW:

 

## User Story
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city 

and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon 

representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, 

and the wind speed WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an 

icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind 

speed, and the humidity WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that 

city
